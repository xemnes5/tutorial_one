# TASK:
# Hereâ€™s a bigger challenge. Write the pseudocode for a program
# where the player and the computer trade places in the number
# guessing game. That is, the player picks a random number
# between 1 and 100 that the computer has to guess. Before you
# start, think about how you guess. If all goes well, try coding the
# game.

        guess = guess + guess/2

        print("Is it", guess, "?")
        answer = input()

    elif answer == "low":
